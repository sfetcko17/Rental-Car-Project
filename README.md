# Rental-Car-Project
Final Python project for rental car check-out process

This code was created as a final project for a class learning how to use the Python language at a fairly basic level. The best thing that I learned from this project was learning how to leave notes for myself in order to help me work back on the project along with showing others my thought process.

The revised edition of the code including extra spacing for easier reading, and creating elif methods to create a more concise code both at the reccomendation of the instructor of the course.
